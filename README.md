I have put a video of the demonstration, PDF of the report, and the code used.

This was a project for my Feedback Control class in Spring of 2025. We had to use
a controller to control the amount of current through a MOSFET using the PWM of 
a Raspberry Pico. We then learned that the resistance of the solenoid changes with 
heat allowing for current through so we had a shunt resistor and found the difference
using an op-amp and used another controller to adjust based on the current change.
